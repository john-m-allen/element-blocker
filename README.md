Element Blocker - Chrome Extension

## Synopsis

This chrome extension adds a menu item to the right click menu to "Remove Element". 

#####TODO:
1. Add persistant remove element over multiple viewing sessions.
2. Add revert functionality (option menu).
3. Add revert last functionality (modal).
4. Add element highlighting.
5. Make it pretty (new styles and icons).

## Motivation

Some sites have content I never want to see. I wanted to create a way to easily remove it in a robust and permanent manner.

## Installation
